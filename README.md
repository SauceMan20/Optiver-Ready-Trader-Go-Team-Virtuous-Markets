Ready Trader Go Competition Submission

Optiver's Ready Trader Go Competition is an Algorithmic Trading Competition for students in Australia and New Zealand.

The aim is to build an automated trading algorithm to be run on a simulated exchange. There are 3 rounds. After each round, performance metrics are provided to further optimise the algorithm.

We competed as team 'Virtuous Markets'.
